## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The application features a modern, dark-themed, three-pane layout built with Python's native Tkinter library, using the `ttk` extension for a contemporary look and feel.

**Key Components:**
* **Main Layout:** A responsive three-pane structure (`ttk.PanedWindow`) consisting of a Toolbar (Left), Main Area (Center), and Properties Panel (Right).
* **Left Toolbar:** Provides quick access to main tools: Cut (`‚úÇÔ∏è`), Move (`üñ±Ô∏è`), Add Text (`üÖ∞Ô∏è`), and Adjust (`‚öôÔ∏è`), along with dedicated buttons for `Import` and `Export` operations.
* **Center Panel:** Vertically split into a top section for the video preview with playback controls, and a bottom, scrollable timeline to visualize video clips.
* **Right Properties Panel:** Features collapsible sections for an uncluttered workspace, including:
    * **Adjustments:** Sliders for fine-tuning Brightness, Contrast, Shadows, Highlights, etc.
    * **Color Mixer:** Sliders for individual RGB color correction.
* **Other Elements:** Includes a standard top menu bar (File, Edit, Help) and a status bar at the bottom to display current actions and messages.
