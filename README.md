# videoeditor
A 7-day plan for a 5-person team to create a basic desktop video editor using Python (`moviepy`, `Tkinter`/`PyQt5`). The plan details daily tasks for coders, a UI designer, and a documentation specialist to implement loading, trimming, filtering, and exporting. Success hinges on daily meetings and version control.
